## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure the extension by passing a table to the `opts` key under `extensions.spinner`.

### Default Configuration

Here is the complete default configuration. You only need to specify the values you wish to override.

```lua
{
	-- The spinner style to use.
	-- Available options: "cursor-relative", "snacks", "fidget", "native", "none"
	style = "cursor-relative",

	-- Default icon to show when spinners are idle (default: "Ôí∏")
	default_icon = "Ôí∏",

	-- A table mapping internal states to their display content (icons and messages).
  content = {
    -- General states
    thinking = { icon = "‚öõ", message = "Thinking...", spacing = "  " },
    receiving = { icon = "ÔÉ≠", message = "Receiving...", spacing = "  " },
    done = { icon = "ÔÄå", message = "Done!", spacing = "  " },
    stopped = { icon = "ÔÅû", message = "Stopped", spacing = "  " },
    cleared = { icon = "Ôá∏", message = "Chat cleared", spacing = "  " },

    -- Tool-related states
    tools_started = { icon = "ÔÇ≠", message = "Running tools...", spacing = "  " },
    tools_finished = { icon = "‚§∑", message = "Processing tool output...", spacing = "  " },

    -- Diff-related states
    diff_attached = { icon = "ÔìÑ", message = "Review changes", spacing = "  " },
    diff_accepted = { icon = "ÔÅò", message = "Change accepted", spacing = "  " },
    diff_rejected = { icon = "ÔÅó", message = "Change rejected", spacing = "  " },

    -- Chat-related states (primarily for notifiers like snacks)

    chat_opened = { icon = "ÔÅµ", message = "Chat opened", spacing = "  " },
    chat_hidden = { icon = "ÔÅ∞", message = "Chat hidden", spacing = "  " },
    chat_closed = { icon = "Ôôô", message = "Chat closed", spacing = "  " },
  },

  -- Spinner-specific settings
  ["cursor-relative"] = {
    text = "ÓÆäÓÆäÓÆä",
    -- text = "ÔÑëÔÑëÔÑë",
    hl_positions = {
      { 0, 3 }, -- First circle
      { 3, 6 }, -- Second circle
      { 6, 9 }, -- Third circle
    },
    interval = 100,
    hl_group = "Title",
    hl_dim_group = "NonText",
  },
  fidget = {
    -- No specific options for now

      row = vim.o.lines - 5,
      col = vim.o.columns - 35,
      style = "minimal",
      border = "rounded",
      title = "CodeCompanion",
      title_pos = "center",
      focusable = false,

## üé® Available Spinners

You can choose one of the following styles by setting the `style` option:

### Quick Overview
- **`cursor-relative`** (Default) - Floating window spinner near cursor
- **`fidget`** - Progress notifications via fidget.nvim
- **`snacks`** - Rich notifications via snacks.nvim or vim.notify
- **`native`** - Highly configurable floating window
- **`none`** - Disable all spinners

### Detailed Descriptions

### `cursor-relative` (Default)

A minimal, animated spinner that floats in a small window next to your cursor. It provides unobtrusive feedback without getting in your way.

**Visuals:**
- **Active:** A smooth highlight animation across the spinner characters (e.g., `ÓÆäÓÆäÓÆä` with moving highlights).
- **Finished:** The spinner is replaced by a checkmark and a "Done!" message, which persists for a short duration before fading away.

**Specific Options:**

```lua
opts = {
  style = "cursor-relative",
  ["cursor-relative"] = {
    -- The spinner text characters
    text = "ÓÆäÓÆäÓÆä",
    -- Alternative: text = "ÔÑëÔÑëÔÑë",

    -- Highlight positions for animation (start_col, end_col pairs)
    hl_positions = {
      { 0, 3 }, -- First circle
      { 3, 6 }, -- Second circle
      { 6, 9 }, -- Third circle
    },

    -- Animation interval in milliseconds
    interval = 100,

    -- Highlight groups
    hl_group = "Title",        -- Active highlight
    hl_dim_group = "NonText",  -- Dimmed background
  },
}
```

### `fidget`

This style leverages the excellent [fidget.nvim](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim) plugin to display progress in the corner of your screen. It's a great choice if you already use `fidget.nvim` for LSP progress.

**Prerequisites:** You must have `j-hui/fidget.nvim` installed.

**Visuals:**
- A "CodeCompanion" task will appear in your fidget window, showing the current status (e.g., "Thinking...").
- When complete, the task is marked as finished.
- This spinner is intentionally simple and only notifies for the `thinking` and `done` states to avoid excessive notifications.

**Specific Options:**
This spinner currently has no specific options.

```lua
opts = {
  style = "fidget",
}
```

---

### `snacks`

This style uses [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) (or the built-in `vim.notify` as a fallback) to show rich, animated notifications. It provides the most detailed feedback of all the spinners.

**Prerequisites:** For the best experience, you should have `folke/snacks.nvim` installed.

**Visuals:**
- A notification popup appears with an icon and status message in the format `<icon> <message>` (e.g., "‚öõ Thinking...").
- The notification updates in-place as the AI moves through different states with animated spinner icons.
- It also shows one-off notifications for events like accepting/rejecting diffs or opening/closing the chat window.

**Specific Options:**
This spinner currently has no specific options.

```lua
opts = {
  style = "snacks",
}
```

---



### `native`

This style creates a highly configurable floating window using Neovim's native `nvim_open_win` function. It provides maximum control over the window's appearance and behavior without requiring any external dependencies.

**Prerequisites:** None - uses only built-in Neovim features.

**Visuals:**
- A floating window appears with your configured title, size, position, and border style.
- The window displays the current status with an animated spinner.
- When complete, shows a "Done!" message before disappearing.

**Specific Options:**

```lua
opts = {
  style = "native",
  native = {
    -- How long (in ms) the "Done!" message should remain visible after completion.
    done_timer = 500,

    -- Window configuration - all nvim_open_win options are supported
    window = {
      -- Position and size
      relative = "editor",        -- "editor", "win", "cursor"
      width = 30,                 -- Window width in characters
      height = 1,                 -- Window height in lines
      row = vim.o.lines - 5,      -- Row position (from top)
      col = vim.o.columns - 35,   -- Column position (from left)

      -- Appearance
      style = "minimal",          -- Window style
      border = "rounded",         -- Border style: "none", "single", "double", "rounded", "solid", "shadow"
      title = "CodeCompanion",    -- Window title text
      title_pos = "center",       -- Title position: "left", "center", "right"

      -- Behavior
      focusable = false,          -- Whether window can receive focus
      noautocmd = true,           -- Disable autocmds for performance
    },

    -- Additional window options using nvim_set_option_value
    win_options = {
      -- winblend = 10,           -- Window transparency (0-100)
      -- winhighlight = "Normal:Normal,FloatBorder:Normal", -- Custom highlighting
    },
  },
}
```

**Advanced Configuration Examples:**

```lua
-- Top-right corner with transparency
native = {
  window = {
    relative = "editor",
    width = 25,
    height = 1,
    row = 1,
    col = vim.o.columns - 30,
    border = "single",
    title = "ü§ñ AI",
    title_pos = "left",
  },
  win_options = {
    winblend = 15,
  },
}

-- Centered with double border
native = {
  window = {
    relative = "editor",
    width = 35,
    height = 1,
    row = math.floor(vim.o.lines / 2) - 10,
    col = math.floor(vim.o.columns / 2) - 17,
    border = "double",
    title = "CodeCompanion Status",
    title_pos = "center",
  },
}
```

### `none`

Disables all spinners and notifications from this extension.

```lua
opts = {
  style = "none",
}
```
